pakol - pack a git repo into a self extracting shell script
===========================================================

Call pakol in the root directory of a git project.
It will create a shell script called <projectname>.pakk.

After copying the shell script somewhere else and calling it,
it will create the <projectname> directory and create the project files in it.

Hint: Add a pakk file to your project. It can be viewed and copy-pasted from
a hosting site, thus downloading the project without downloading the project.

Caveat Programmor
-----------------

There should be a trailing newline in the last line of each file.
Use a decent editor, like vi, vi or vi, or if there is no other way, vi.

May or may not work with binary files. Most probably not.
